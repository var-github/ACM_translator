## The project aims to create an ML model to convert English to French
The architecture used is LSTM. The code used to train the model is at <https://github.com/var-github/ACM_ML/blob/main/Language_translation.ipynb>

To see the results I created a webpage hosted at <https://acmtranslator.streamlit.app/>
